Unity_WinForm_Pipes
===================

Scripts and sample apps demonstrating communication between Unity3D and WinForms via pipes

I needed a quick and simple solution to allow me to communicate between some of my old projects both developed as WinForm/WPF Apps and in versions of .Net (4/4.5) not compatible with Unity and this is what I came up with.

At the heart of the example are two classes:

ClientPipe.cs and ServerPipe.cs

Both of these classes can be utilised to provide .Net and Unity3D applications with capability for intercommunication.

A tutorial is currently on the way and will be available via: http://www.dyadica.co.uk

Enjoy :)
